## Standalone sub-projects

This repository illustrates different concepts, patterns and examples via standalone sub-projects. Each sub-project is
completely independent of the others and do not depend on the root project. This _standalone sub-project constraint_
forces the sub-projects to be complete and maximizes the reader's chances of successfully running, understanding, and
re-using the code.

The sub-projects include:

### `interactive/`

An interactive program to consume from Kafka using the _plain-ole'/regular/vanilla_ Java [KafkaConsumer](https://github.com/apache/kafka/tree/40b0033eedf823d3bd3c6781cfd871a949c5827e/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer).

**TIP**: This is a good project to start with you if you are just learning about Kafka, or more specifically you are
learning how to interface with Kafka via a Java program.

See [interactive/README.md](interactive/README.md). 

### `kafka-in-kafka-out/`

A simple *Kafka in, Kafka out* Java program accompanied by an out-of-process test harness.

See [kafka-in-kafka-out/README.md](kafka-in-kafka-out/README.md).

### `streams/`

A basic [Kafka Streams](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/) application.

See [streams/README.md](streams/README.md).

### `spring-seekable/`

A basic [Spring Kafka](https://spring.io/projects/spring-kafka) application with a "seekable" Kafka listener.

See [spring-seekable/README.md](spring-seekable/README.md).

### `spring-headers/`

A basic [Spring Kafka](https://spring.io/projects/spring-kafka) application that showcases the Spring framework behavior
around Kafka message headers.

See [spring-headers/README.md](spring-headers/README.md).

### `spring-errors/`

A basic [Spring Kafka](https://spring.io/projects/spring-kafka) application that showcases the Spring framework features
and behavior around Kafka error handling.

See [spring-errors/README.md](spring-errors/README.md).

### `utility-scripts/`

Utility Bash scripts for starting and stopping Kafka and Zookeeper.

See [utility-scripts/README.md](utility-scripts/README.md).
