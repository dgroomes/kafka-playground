# Start Kafka using KRaft (Kafka Raft). With KRaft, Zookeeper is not needed!

# Assumes that Kafka is installed. I installed Kafka with `brew install kafka`.
#
# TIP: Adjust log levels as needed using the "log4j.properties" file. Then look at the logs in "tmp-kafka/logs/". It will
# be a lot of information but with some determination it is an effective way to learn and experiment with Kafka.
#
# NOTE: This is not an idiomatic way to run Kafka. This was my best attempt to script out a way to run Kafka for local
# development.
