# ssl-tls-security

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

An example Kafka project showcasing Kafka's support for SSL/TLS security.

---
**NOTE**: Although TLS (Transport Layer Security) has replaced SSL completely, the SSL name lives on. I've included "ssl-"
in the name of this sub-project because the name SSL is still so common.

---

Dealing with certificates can be a bit of a mystery to most engineers. I'd like to de-mystify it with a practical example:
a Kafka producer and consumer using TLS!

## Notes

Miscellaneous notes and commands:

* http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security
* Using Java 11
* `keytool -keystore generated.pk12 -alias localhost -validity 3650 -genkey -keyalg RSA -storetype pkcs12`
  * Can I create the keystore without all the interactive prompts for things like name and country?
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4907622/keytool-see-the-public-and-private-keys#comment101625804_45891165
* `openssl pkcs12 -in generated.pk12 -nocerts -nodes`
* `openssl pkcs12 -in generated.pk12 -nodes`
* Observation: pkcs12 seems to be the modern way. Avoid jks files and prefer pkcs12. Commonly ending with the file extension
  `.pk12` (I think?)?  
* Can I open a pkcs12 file with [keystore-explorer](https://github.com/kaikramer/keystore-explorer)?
* What is PKCS11 and why does keystore-explorer have an "Open Special" option for it? Does it not know about PKCS12?
* Whoa, keystore-explorer can detect the type of a file! For example, it detected that the my `generated.pk12` file was
  "PKCS #12 KeyStore". And when I renamed it to something with a misleading file extension, like `generated.txt`, it
  still detected that it was PKCS #12!
* Shoot, keystore-explorer cant' inspect PKCS 12 files? I got the error
  > org.kse.crypto.keystore.KeyStoreLoadException: Could not load KeyStore as type 'PKCS12'
* **Concept: certificate chains**: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509#Certificate_chains_and_cross-certification> 
  * What does the "Subject" and "Issuer" fields mean in a certificate?
* What is the difference between a certificate and a private key? I know private keys are private and certificates are
  public but I mean what actually *is* a key and what actually *is* a certificate and how are they different?
  Answer:
  > A TLS public key is distributed in a file called a certificate. It is called a certificate because it is certified to
  > contain a valid public key by a digital signature. There are a few different techniques used to sign the certificates used by sendmail.
  -- from [*Sendmail Cookbook*](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/sendmail-cookbook/0596004710/ch08.html)
* > This is because several CA certificates can be generated for the same subject and public key, but be signed with different
  > private keys (from different CAs or different private keys from the same CA).
  What does this mean?
* > At the bottom of the display is the digital signature of the certificate created by the CA. It is an MD5 digest of the
  > certificate, which is stored in the sendmail configuration in the macro ${cert_md5}. The digest is encrypted by the CA’s
  > private key. sendmail uses the CA’s public key to decrypt the digest. If sendmail successfully decrypts and verifies
  > the digest, it stores OK in the macro ${verify} and considers the certificate valid for authentication.
  What does this mean?

## Instructions

* Install Kafka and `kafkacat`:
    * `brew install kafka`
    * `brew install kafkacat`
* Create the certificate objects (warning: this process is pretty involved!):
    * Note: the following instructions are mostly derived from the [Apache Kafka docs on security](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security)
    * Create a root certificate (you will see this referred to as a CA using a homegrown PKI)
      * ```
        openssl req -x509 \
        -new \
        -keyout root-private-key.pem \
        -out root-cert.pem \
        -subj "/C=US/ST=mystate/L=mycity /O=myorgOU=myorgunit/CN=myname/emailAddress=myemail"
        ```
      * It will prompt you to create a password. Create one.        
      * Command explanation: the `req` sub-command of the `openssl` command is designed to create certificate signing
        requests (CSRs) but when the `-x509` option is given it creates a self-signed cert. We will use this as our root
        certificate, or "trust anchor" from which all other components of our PKI will assume trust.  
    * Create a PKCS12-style Java keystore intended for the Kafka broker with the following command:
    * ```
      keytool \
        -keystore kafka-broker-keystore-unsigned.pk12 \
        -alias localhost \
        -validity 3650 \
        -genkey \
        -keyalg RSA \
        -storetype pkcs12 \
        -dname "cn=myname, ou=myorgunit, o=myorg, c=US"
      ```
    * TODO Why use `keytool` for this? I would prefer to stick with `openssl` because that is a more transferable tool. After
      all, if I'm setting up TLS things for apps based in GoLang then I won't have `keytool` because it's a Java tool. Is
      there a unique advantage to using `keytool` or does it just provide some convenience for Java developers?
      Alternatively, can we come up with a combination of `openssl` commands that do the same thing that the `keytool`
      command does? Let's find out below:
      * Create a key-pair (I think you have to create it into separate files: the private key and the certificate. Later,
        you can combine it into a PKCS12 archive file. `keytool` does this in one command not two!)
        ```
        openssl req -x509 \
        -new \
        -keyout kafka-broker-private-key.pem \
        -out kafka-broker-cert-unsigned.pem \
        -nodes \
        -subj "/C=US/ST=mystate/L=mycity /O=myorgOU=myorgunit/CN=mykafkabrokername/emailAddress=myemail"                
        ```
        Explanation of command: `-nodes` is short for "no DES" and it means it won't generate a password for the private
        key.
      * WIP Next, combine them into a PKCS12 file which is needed (I think?) to create the certificate signing request.
        ```
        openssl pkcs12 \
        -export \
        -out kafka-broker-keystore-unsigned.pk12 \
        -inkey kafka-broker-private-key.pem \
        -in kafka-broker-cert-unsigned.pem \
        -passout pass:
        ```
        Explanation of command: `-passout pass:` means that the created PKCS12 will have a blank password (or no password?)
        protecting the secret key. See [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56552040).
    * It will prompt you to create a password. Create one.
    * As is, this cert is not useful because it is not signed by the root certificate. Remember, the root certificate is
      the only thing we trust implicitly (it is a "trust anchor") while the Kafka broker's certificate will be trusted
      thanks, to math! We *derive* trust in the Kafka broker's cert because it will be signed by the root cert. 
* Start Zookeeper and Kafka (TODO enable SSL):
    * `./scripts/start-kafka.sh`
* Start a Kafka consumer:
    * TODO
* Produce a message:
    * TODO
    * Verify that you see it in the consumer!
    * Success!
* Stop Zookeeper and Kafka:
    * `./scripts/stop-kafka.sh`

    it is visiting? And then the path validation algorithm validates this anchor and then all the "parent" (my word) certificates
    until it gets to a root certificate?
